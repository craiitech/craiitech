## Core Features:

- Role-Based Access: Secure access to dashboards and functionalities based on user roles (Admin, Campus Director, Campus ODIMO, Unit ODIMO, Employee).
- Submission Management: Enable employees and Unit ODIMOs to submit reports via Google Drive links, adhering to submission windows for each cycle (First & Final).

- Admin Controls: Provide administrators with tools to manage campuses, units, user registrations, submission deadlines, and organizational hierarchies.
